### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [mb bischoff](https://mbbischoff.com/ "mb's website."), a software designer and developer in New York City. I co-founded and help to run [Lickability](https://lickability.com/ "mb's development studio."), a small studio where we craft delightful apps for our clients and ourselves. A few times a year, I'll give a [talk at a conference or appear on a podcast](https://mbbischoff.com/about/#appearances "mb's talks and appearances.") about the work I do.

In my spare time, I enjoy mixing [classic cocktails](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFAvu9XJfBc/ "A photo of a cocktail on mb’s's Instagram account."), going to the [theatre](https://www.instagram.com/p/B66KDr1puek/ "A photo of a theatre on mb's Instagram account."), reading and editing [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Matthewbischoff "mb's Wikipedia account."), and volunteering with [Trans Lifeline](https://translifeline.org/ "A support service for the trans community."). I'm proudly bisexual, trans, and nonbinary. Oh yeah, and [one time I was on Jeopardy!](https://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=3342 "Details about the episode of Jeopardy! that mb appeared on.")

### What hardware do you use?

Most of my work takes place on my 16-inch Intel [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] in Space Gray which is spec'd out with a 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9, 32 GB of RAM, and 2 TB of flash storage. It's connected to an [LG UltraFine 5K Display][ultrafine-5k], [Magic Keyboard][magic-keyboard], [Magic Trackpad][magic-trackpad], and a [RØDE Podcaster][podcaster] when I'm guesting on podcasts. 

I'm lit by an [El Gato Key Light Air][key-light-air], write with a Pilot [Hi-Tec-C][hi-tec-c] or [Lamy 2000][2000], and keep track of my daily writing habit with the [Every Day Calendar][every-day-calendar]. All of these objects are often within reach on my Artifox Desk 01 or sometimes packed in a black leather Hard Graft backpack.

When I'm out and about or (more often these days) lounging in my apartment, I use a [Pacific Blue iPhone 12 Pro][iphone-12-pro] or a [Space Gray 11" iPad Pro][ipad-pro] to check-in on social media and get work done and a [Kindle Voyage][kindle-voyage] to read books.

I'm most often wearing a [pronoun pin from Gamut Pins](https://gamutpins.bigcartel.com/product/large-they-them-enamel-pronoun-pin-black "A they/them pronoun badge."), a 44 mm Stainless Steel [Apple Watch Series 5][apple-watch-series-5] with a Solo Loop band in Deep Navy, [Tom Ford lip color in Cherry Lush](https://www.tomford.com/lip-color/8806601067.html "A lipstick."), [Glossier Boy Brow in Clear](https://www.glossier.com/products/boy-brow "An eyebrow wax."), [Escentric 03 perfume](https://www.luckyscent.com/product/30809/escentric-03-by-escentric-molecules "A perfume."), denim from Nudie, and [Atoms sneakers][model-000]. I carry [AirPods Pro][airpods-pro] plus my cards and keys in a wallet and pouch from Hard Graft.

Pleasure is as important as work. I brew coffee from [Bottomless][] ground by the [Baratza Virtuoso][virtuoso] with a Chemex, tea from [Harney & Sons](https://www.harney.com/ "A tea company.") in the [Joey Roth Sorapot](https://coolhunting.com/design/sorapot-2-by-joey-roth/), and mix cocktails with equipment from [Cocktail Kingdom](https://www.cocktailkingdom.com/ "A bartender supply company."). My sex toy collection is extensive, thanks in part to being married to a [sex blogger](https://girlyjuice.net/ "Kate Sloan's weblog.") who always knows what's good; I like the stuff from [Njoy](https://www.njoytoys.com/ "A sex toy company.") and [Fun Factory](https://en.funfactory.com/ "A sex toy company.").

### And what software?

I have an often obsessive, [love-hate relationship](https://www.wired.com/story/power-paradox-bad-software/ "A Wired article about the imbalances in software quality in various industries.") with software as someone who's been using it and making it for most of my life.

### What would be your dream setup?

Technology that serves us, rather than the other way around. Hardware that just works™ consistently, without all the fuss. Software that is fast, designed for the platform it runs on, and gets out of the way.
